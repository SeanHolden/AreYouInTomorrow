#Are You In Tomorrow?


###What is this?

A service to find out who is in tomorrow and who is off or working from home.

###How does it work?

When completed, it should gather data from members of a particular work team about whether they will be in the office or not on any given day. This data can then be viewed through a web page to enable fellow work colleagues to know whether to expect a particular work colleague to arrive in the office on that day.

###Environment variables needed:

* TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
* TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
* TWILIO_PHONE_NO
